AI Video Editing Platform

![Early concept drawing of Pokora interface](pokora_concept.png)

Pokora is a video editing and creation platform that combines existing video clips with AI generated video clips.

- Loading source clips decomposes them into source frames
- Each frame can be part of an image 2 image AI process based on a text prompt, with a given strength
- The strength can change (in forward or reverse) to go closer to the original or further away
- AI clips can be generated image 2 image based on the previous frame, rather than a source frame
- The resulting output can be played back with sound from the original source clip
- Sections be reprocessed without having to reprocess the entire output
